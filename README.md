# PropertyCollectorRoslyn
This program extracts some information about properties from a SyntaxTree which was defined in the main method. It uses Roslyn to find information about Properties and searches through all classes of the Tree to find them. The advantage of using Roslyn over Reflection for this task is that it can extract the XML-Summary of a property. The disadvantage of using Roslyn over Reflection is that you can't get direct access to the values of the Properties. An indirect tinkered way to do this is to use the collected information to generate code to call properties like it's done with the SwitchCase generator inside the PropertyProcessor class. Other methods of this class allow you to print all Properties and to write all properties into a csv file. All in all this program can be useful to get a better overview over .cs-files with a large number of properties.
